    "Dota2 by Valve is a popular computer game with a player base of 6 million unique users. \n",
    "Each Dota 2 match consists of two teams of five players pitted against each other. Before a match begins, each player selects a character to play as, known as a “hero,” from a pool of 113 different heroes. Once a player chooses a hero, no other player can select that hero for the same match. Heroes have a wide-range of characteristics and abilities that, combined with the massive hero pool, make each match unique."

    "An interesting aspect of the game is that in choosing a hero, players must keep in mind not only the individual strengths and weaknesses of each hero, but also how the strengths and weaknesses of that hero interacts with the heroes already chosen by other players. An effective hero pick is one that synergizes with the heroes chosen by teammates, and both exploits the weaknesses and minimizes the strengths of the heroes chosen by the opposing team. Assuming equally skilled teams, the ramifications of hero selection can be so staggering that well devised hero choices can implicitly give a team a large advantage before the match even begins. The goal of our project is to recommend heroes that will perform well against an opposing team of heroes."

    "With 106 heroes to choose from and five heroes per team, we are attempting to find the best five heroes for any given matchup, which results in over eight quadrillion possible team combinations. On a deeper level, recommending heroes using machine learning is challenging because it tries to capture via raw data what professional players have developed a gut instinct for through hundreds of thousands of hours of play time."
