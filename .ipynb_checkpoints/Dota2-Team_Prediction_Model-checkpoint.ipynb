    "Dota2 by Valve is a popular computer game with a player base of 6 million unique users. \n",
    "Each Dota 2 match consists of two teams of five players pitted against each other. Before a match begins, each player selects a character to play as, known as a “hero,” from a pool of 106 different heroes. Once a player chooses a hero, no other player can select that hero for the same match. Heroes have a wide-range of characteristics and abilities that, combined with the massive hero pool, make each match unique."
